Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

This has \\nto be done in a much larger scale through countrywide participatio n of multiple \\ninstitutions. Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \\nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \\nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \\nme the \\nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I \\nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \\nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \\non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \\n\"When you wish upon a star, \\nMakes no difference who you are, \\nAnything your heart desires, \\nWill come to you” \\nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am \\nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \\n \\nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \\ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \\n \\n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \\n \\n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and \\nquality water. \\n \\n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in symphony. \\n \\n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \\ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \\n \\n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and \\ninvestors.'),\n",
